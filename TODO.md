# AI things to look into

1. https://skills.sh/
2. Gemini CLI
3. Automaker
4. https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done

Given that https://skills.sh exist (`npx skills add https://github.com/supabase/agent-skills --skill supabase-postgres-best-practices`), maybe in the future I will have my own custom AGENTS.md file, and a list of skills I want to install and a script will handle it all for me?
