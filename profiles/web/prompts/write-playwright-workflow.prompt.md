description: Add a Playwright workflow test for a critical user journey.
---

Create a Playwright **workflow** test for the described critical user journey:
- Focus on business-critical steps across pages.
- Avoid fragile selectors tied to styling/layout.
- Prefer stable roles, labels, test ids.
- Keep the test comprehensive but not bloated.
