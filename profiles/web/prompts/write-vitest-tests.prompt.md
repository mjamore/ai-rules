description: Generate minimal, high-value Vitest coverage without snapshots.
---

Write Vitest unit tests for the selected file:
- Cover the most important behavior and edge cases.
- Avoid snapshot tests.
- Keep tests minimal and readable.
- Co-locate tests next to source using `*.test.ts`.
- If dependencies need mocking, do the lightest mocking possible.
