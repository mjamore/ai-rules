# Code Review

Review the selected changes for:
- Correctness (logic, edge cases, error handling)
- Security (secrets, injections, authz/authn assumptions)
- Performance (unnecessary work, N+1, excessive renders)
- Maintainability (naming, structure, cohesion)
- Tests (are the right things covered, no snapshots)

Output:
1) Summary (2-4 bullets)
2) Issues (prioritized, with suggested fixes)
3) Optional improvements
